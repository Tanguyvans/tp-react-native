# Create Project

This first exercise is about creating a new project from scratch.

## Step 1: Create a new project

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest [project-name]
```

## Step 2: Install dependencies

Go to the project folder and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd [project-name]
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Run the project

To run the project, we will use the following command. Make sure that your computer and mobile device are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

```bash
npx expo start
```

If you are having issues running the project, you can try the following command:

```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

This will create a tunnel to the project and you will be able to access it from your mobile device.
