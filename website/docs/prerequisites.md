# Prerequisites

Before getting into the exercises, ensure you have the following tools and software installed on your machine.

## Required Software

### Node.js

- Install Node.js LTS version (16.x or higher)
- Verify installation:

```bash
node -v
```

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/fr/download). I recommend installing using nvm. nvm is a tool that allows you to install and manage different versions of Node.js. For this workshop, we will use Node.js 22.14.0.

If you already have nvm installed, you can install with:

```bash
nvm install 22.14.0
```

### Git

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Verify installation:

```bash
git --version
```

### React Native Development Environment

Depending on your OS, you will need to install different tools. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/).
